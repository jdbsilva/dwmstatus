# dwmstatus
C program for DWM status bar. This is underwork and was only tested in Arch Linux.  

Remarkable TODOS: 
i) Replace printf with XSetRoot. As it is necessary to use bash in .xinitrc. 
ii) Present code is only valid for WIFI. Someting similar has to be done for wired network. 
iii) Warning function has to be implemented.
